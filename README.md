Creating a README file is a good practice to document and explain your code or project to other developers or users. Here's an example of how you might structure a README file for a project that includes the `checkAnagrams` function:

# Anagram Checker

This project contains a JavaScript function to check if two strings are anagrams of each other.


## Introduction

Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. The `checkAnagrams` function in this project helps determine if two input strings are anagrams of each other.

## Function Description

The `checkAnagrams` function takes two strings as input and returns `true` if they are anagrams, and `false` otherwise. It performs the following steps:
1. Removes non-word characters and converts both strings to lowercase.
2. Sorts the characters in each string.
3. Compares the sorted strings and returns the result.

## Usage

You can use the `checkAnagrams` function in your JavaScript projects by including it in your code. Here's an example:

```javascript
// Include the checkAnagrams function here

const string1 = 'listen';
const string2 = 'silent';

if (checkAnagrams(string1, string2)) {
  console.log(`${string1} and ${string2} are anagrams.`);
} else {
  console.log(`${string1} and ${string2} are not anagrams.`);
}
```

Replace `string1` and `string2` with your desired input strings.

You can create a `README.md` file in your project directory and paste the content above. Customize it further based on your project's specific details, such as installation instructions, examples, or additional information about the functions or modules included in your project.
